# Text-and-File-Encryption-and-Decryption-to-Send-Via-Email-using-Double-Layered-Cryptosystem

•	Analyzed and compared the performance of DES, AES, RSA, and ECC algorithms. Developed and implemented a Double Layered Cryptosystem in Java on VS Studio. Integrated a simple cipher to protect plaintext from exposure.
•	Demonstrated the system to be 9.15% faster than DES and 12.44% slower than AES for 10MB files. Achieved 92.65% faster encryption than RSA and 94.83% faster than ECC for large files. Improved encryption time by 21% and 17.41% over RSA and ECC, respectively, for varying file sizes.
•	Suggested further comparison with popular mail encryption techniques like SSL.
